# BankApi

The latest LTS version of .NET 8 was chosen for the project. I chose a clean architecture, as it will allow for easy development and maintenance in the future, as well as easy writing of unit tests. For demonstration purposes, I'm storing data in the entity framework's in-memory database, although a true persistent database would, of course, be chosen for production.
